    service: "Consultation",
    Description:
      "Our team provide 24*7 hours consultation for dogs. During your dog’s consultation, we will take a history and discuss with you your dog’s symptoms. Your dog will be examined by the vet, looking at key areas of concern but also taking into account a wider overview of their body systems. For larger dogs, this usually takes place on the floor and for smaller pets, on the consulting table. We feel that you and your dog deserve not to feel rushed during the consultation, so all our appointments are at least 15 minutes long. If you are seeing our specialist this will take longer, so please take this into account when arranging your appointment.To assist us in diagnosing your dog’s problems it is always a great help if any records you have of changes in their normal routine. Videos of unusual behaviour and, in the case of any urinary problems, a sample is always appreciated! If your dog is on medication, or supplements we don’t know about, it is helpful if you have these records with you. If you think your dog has ingested a toxic substance, keeping that packaging can speed up identifying the correct treatment.",
