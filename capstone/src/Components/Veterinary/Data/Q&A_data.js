    question: "My Dog Ate A Chicken Bone- What Do I Do?",
    Description:
      "When we think of our dog’s wild ancestors, we often picture dogs in the forest, snacking on the bones of their most recent prey. \r\n We know these dogs likely consumed bones of all kinds, with some wild dogs even gnawing on bones to this day. \n Large animal bones are even sold in pet stores as treats, so does this mean all bones are safe for dogs to consume? \n Chicken is prepared in homes across the world, meaning many pups out there have an opportunity to snack on the bones. While our pups may be interested in this enticing treat, it is not a safe option at the end of the day.\n ",

    question: "Why Are My Dogs Eyes Red?",
    Description:
      "Your Dog Has Dry Eyes. Dry eye occurs because the eyes don’t produce sufficient tears. Since tears are necessary to keep debris and infection out of the eyes, without them the cornea will become inflamed. Not only does this make your dog’s eyes red, but it also can cause a good deal of pain. There are a number of reasons why your dog’s eyes may be red due to dry eye, but damage to the tissue that is supposed to create tears is one of the most common. When left untreated, dry eye can result in serious issues for your dog. However, treatments are simple and straightforward. There are several effective medications for dog dry eye which are drops that can easily be put into the eye once or twice a day. ",

    question: "My Dog Is Drooling And Acting Strange",
    Description:
      "Your Dog Is Stressed Or Has Anxiety Excessive drooling is not always a result of health issues, but rather an intense emotional response to the world around them. Our canine friends can experience stress and anxiety just like you and I can, and these reactions can have a bodily response. Drooling for dogs can be comparable to biting nails when we are nervous, making it fairly normal for some furry friends. In addition to the drool that begins to pull in their mouth, your pup may also display other strange behaviors like whining, shaking, panting, hiding, and pacing. Your Dog Is Excited, Not only can dogs begin to drool and act strange when they are anxious, but they can experience these same symptoms with excitement as well. A dog that is overcome with joy may begin to salivate and slobber, whether they are excited for a meal or they are seeing their favorite person. If it seems like your happy pup is slobbering and whining each time they get excited, this may be completely normal for them.",
